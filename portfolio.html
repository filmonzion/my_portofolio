                      <p class="card-text">Tiger is a wild animal. It usually lives in the dark and dense forests. It is the national animal of India. A tiger has thick yellow skin with dark black stripes on the whole body. Interestingly, every tiger has a unique pattern of black stripes on his skin like the finger-prints of humans. Tiger is well known for its amazing energy, speed, and stamina.
                            We can see them at the Zoo. The Bengal Tiger has the largest population among all the subspecies of Tiger. Killing the tigers is completely prohibited in India. It is one of the most ruthless wild animals in the World which, unfortunately, has now become an endangered animal.</p>

                      <h5 class="card-title">Bighorn Sheep</h5>
                      <p class="card-text">Bighorn Sheep are large mammals that are relatives of goats. They have short brown fur, a white muzzle and rump patch. Bighorn sheep are named for the large, curved horns borne by the rams (males). Ewes (females) also have horns, but they are shorter with less curvature. They range in color from light brown to grayish or dark, chocolate brown, with a white rump and lining on the backs of all four legs.
                          Male bighorn sheep have large horn cores, enlarged cornual and frontal sinuses, and internal bony septa. These adaptations serve to protect the brain by absorbing the impact of clashes.</p>
                       <p>Bighorns from the Rocky Mountains are relatively large, with males that occasionally exceed 230 kg (500 lb) and females that exceed 90 kg (200 lb). In contrast, Sierra Nevada bighorn males weigh up to only 90 kg (198 lb) and females to 60 kg (132 lb). Male horns can weigh up to 14 kg (30 lb), as much as all the bones in the male's body.</p>

                      <h5 class="card-title">Zebra</h5>
                      <p class="card-text">Most of us have seen Zebras at the zoos. They almost resemble a horse and also move, gallop and trot like horses.
                          However, they do not run like horses and are not domesticated. They are known as wild animals. They fall into the equidae family where the horses and donkeys also include.</p>
                      <p>Every Zebra does have a very unique pattern of black and white stripes on them, which is never similar for two Zebras. They are also known as odd ungulates which mean that they have odd number of toes on their hoofs.
                          The eyes of the Zebra are located at the sides of their heads. This makes them see at a better angle when a predator is around. They have excellent sense of taste and smell and 
                          also good hearing powers. Their night vision helps them to see at night and keeps them away from predators. Since they have a shiny coat on their body, it helps them to have a control of the heat from the sun.</p>

                      <h5 class="card-title">Cheetah</h5>
                      <p class="card-text">Cheetahs are very cool cats. I find it very funny how they sleep in the tree and do nothing the whole day, 
                        but when it comes to hunting they are the fastest animal on the land! I once saw a documentary about the cheetah and it was so 
                        interesting to see how the cheetahs live and act. That is why I chose this animal. I also think that the cheetah looks very cute!</p>
                      <p>Cheetahs are build for speed. It has long, slim and muscular legs. With these legs he can run very fast when hunting his prey.
                        The cheetah is also very flexible. It has to be fast and/or defend himself against enemies; it has to be able to go in al directions. It also has a long tail for balance, so he doesn’t fall when it changes direction.
                        The cheetah has a yellowish fur with small black spots dotted on it.</p>
